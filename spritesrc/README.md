# Notes

Scanline versions of the HUD need to be placed in `sprites/op4`. The HD HUD sprites need to be renamed to remove the `_scanline` suffix.

`hud_train.spr` & `op4/hud_train.spr` are `640_train.spr` taken from Half-Life and Opposing Force.
`hud_pain.spr` & `op4/hud_pain.spr` are `640_pain.spr` taken from Half-Life and Opposing Force.
